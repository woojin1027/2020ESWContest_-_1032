# Summary

*Update May 2018 see [lienbacher's](https://www.thingiverse.com/lienbacher/about) comment below for a version that will work with a Pi 3 B+, which has addition POE pins.  I updated the v2.1 version on here with a larger pin cutout but don't have a Pi 3 B+ to test with*

*Updated March 2018: Added a new version (2.0) with a larger cutout for the microSD card since newer models aren't spring loaded.  I also loosened up the tolerances and tweaked the design to make it easier to print, and added a latch to the cap so the Raspberry Pi is less likely to fall out.*

Simple sleeve to protect a [Raspberry Pi*](https://amzn.to/2H4aCvp) from falling screws.  The main part of the case slides over the Raspberry Pi, and a cap fits around the connectors.  The parts are only held in place by friction so it probably isn't a good option for transport or if you frequently plug / unplug devices (mine just sits under my printer running [Octoprint](http://octoprint.org)).  Only the ports along the sides are exposed.  

The cap part may need a small amount scaling on the z axis since the height can vary significantly with layer height and first layer thickness.
